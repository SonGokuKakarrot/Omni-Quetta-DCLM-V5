# Discord VC Mic Maximizer (Firefox / Android-compatible WebExtension)

This extension injects into Discord Web and wraps microphone capture (`getUserMedia`) with:
- gain boost,
- vocal compression,
- basic EQ,
- a limiter to reduce clipping.

## Why AMO rejected your ZIP

If AMO says **"manifest.json was not found"**, your ZIP layout is wrong.

You likely uploaded a ZIP of the parent folder, e.g.:
- `OmniLMExtension-main/manifest.json`

AMO requires:
- `manifest.json` at ZIP root directly.

## Correct packaging (fixed)

Use the included packaging script:

```bash
bash scripts/package-amo.sh
```

This creates:
- `dist/omnilmextension-amo.zip`

and validates `manifest.json` is at ZIP root.

## Manual packaging (if needed)

From repository root:

```bash
zip -r omnilmextension-amo.zip manifest.json content popup README.md
```

Do **not** zip the containing directory name.

## Install from GitHub / AMO

### Desktop Firefox (for testing)
1. Open `about:debugging`.
2. Click **This Firefox**.
3. Click **Load Temporary Add-on**.
4. Select `manifest.json`.

### Firefox on Android
Firefox stable Android does **not** generally allow arbitrary unsigned extension sideloading. Usual path:
1. Use **Firefox Nightly for Android**.
2. Enable custom add-on collection (AMO developer flow).
3. Upload/sign this extension on AMO (unlisted is fine).
4. Add signed add-on to your custom collection.
5. Install from that collection in Nightly.

## Usage
1. Enable extension.
2. Open `https://discord.com/app`.
3. Join VC.
4. Tune gain/compression from popup.

If Discord reconnects (including region/server change), it usually requests mic again; this extension re-processes each new `getUserMedia` mic stream.

## Recommended Discord settings
- Input Sensitivity: manual and low threshold.
- Disable Echo Cancellation/Noise Suppression/Automatic Gain Control in Discord if your voice becomes unstable.
- Keep boost moderate to avoid pumping/clipping.

## Optional extra equalizer extension?
For **mic input specifically**, you do not need another EQ extension if this one is enabled. This extension already applies a low shelf and high shelf EQ in the mic chain.

## Important limit
No extension can guarantee 100% always-loudest output in every VC condition, because Discord/device/network processing can still alter transmitted loudness.

## AMO validation error shown in screenshot (fixed)

If AMO reports:
- `required must NOT have fewer than 1 items`

it means `browser_specific_settings.gecko.data_collection_permissions.required` was empty.
It must contain `"none"` or one/more supported data types.

This manifest now uses:
- `required: ["none"]`

If AMO warns about unsupported key for minimum Firefox version, raise
`strict_min_version` to a version that supports `data_collection_permissions`.
This project now uses `142.0` for Firefox/Android compatibility with that key.


## Louder + clearer profile update

This version increases default loudness/clarity with:
- stronger default gain/compression,
- added high-pass cleanup,
- added presence EQ band for voice intelligibility.

For aggressive loudness, set gain near 36-42 dB carefully to avoid clipping artifacts.


## If extension installs but mic does not change

Root cause: Firefox content scripts run in an isolated world. Patching `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` only in content-script scope may not affect Discord page JavaScript.

Fix in this repo: content script now injects a page-context hook script and sends config via `window.postMessage`, so Discord's own WebRTC calls are wrapped.

### Extra loud mode
Defaults now start in a much louder profile and explicitly disable browser capture AGC/noise suppression/echo cancellation constraints in the hook path for stronger raw mic level.

### Pro Loud profile
Added dual-stage compression + saturation drive + loudness gain stage for a stronger perceived loud output in Discord VC.

### Extreme loudness setting
Loudness max and default are set to 20.00x as requested. This can cause severe distortion/clipping depending on mic and Discord processing.


## V2 module layout
- `content/loader.js`: injects page hook file.
- `core/injector.js`: page-context WebRTC hook + DSP chain.
- `content/service.js`: storage sync + watchdog config pushes.
- `background.js`: extension lifecycle module.


## Security model (non-obfuscated)
This project intentionally avoids obfuscated loader patterns. The extension does **not** include:
- remote code fetch loaders,
- token/session extraction logic,
- tracking beacons,
- hidden `eval`/dynamic code execution.

Run local check:
```bash
bash scripts/security-check.sh
```


### Background safety
`background.js` in this project does not send data to any external webhook or remote server. It only tracks local hook heartbeat status for diagnostics.


### Why this is better than obfuscated loader blobs
- Readable source (no string-array obfuscation)
- No anti-debug traps / self-defending code
- No remote fetch/eval execution path
- Deterministic reinjection + heartbeat for reliability diagnostics


### Token-scraper defense policy
This extension must never read Discord auth tokens from `localStorage` and must never exfiltrate data to webhooks.
Blocked patterns include:
- `localStorage.getItem(...)` token scraping paths,
- `sendWebhook` style exfiltration actions,
- `discord.com/api/webhooks` endpoints.


## Quetta Android compatibility
Quetta is Chromium-based and supports many Chrome/Edge extensions on Android. This project now uses a runtime API shim (`EXT = browser || chrome`) so the same code path can run on Firefox and Chromium-family browsers like Quetta.

If Quetta disables an extension after restart, re-enable it from Quetta extension manager and avoid unpacked/sideloaded temporary installs when possible.


### Hook status indicator
Popup now shows whether the page hook heartbeat is active. If it says NOT DETECTED, open Discord tab and refresh once.


## Revenge/Bunny plugin scaffold
A separate plugin scaffold is included under `revenge-plugin/` with:
- `manifest.json`
- `index.js` using `@vendetta/metro`, `@vendetta/plugin`, and `@vendetta/ui/toasts`

It patches `MediaEngine.setInputVolume` with watchdog re-patching and clean unload restore.


### Revenge plugin multi-hook strategy
`revenge-plugin/index.js` now attempts multiple native media-engine hook methods (`setInputVolume`, `setInputGain`, `setLocalVolume`, `setSelfMuteVolume`) and re-hooks automatically on engine reset.


### Revenge plugin internal API
`revenge-plugin/index.js` now includes:
- Engine discovery + fallback hook paths
- Rehook watchdog for reconnect/engine reset
- Safe gain staging + hard cap clamping
- Dynamic profile presets (`clean`, `aggressive`, `extreme`)
- In-plugin settings storage + live apply
- Status toasts/logs for active/inactive hook state

## Quetta reliability / live loudness update
Version 2.1.0 improves Quetta stability by:
- keeping active audio graphs in memory and updating node parameters live when sliders move,
- falling back to the original microphone request if Quetta rejects raw-capture constraints, then still applying the DSP chain,
- preserving non-audio tracks when returning the processed stream,
- adding a 50x loudness ceiling and two popup presets: `Stable Clear` and `50x Boost`.

Use `Stable Clear` first. Use `50x Boost` only if your voice is not clipping; if it cracks, reduce `Drive`, `Gain`, or `Loudness`.
